    <p id = 'intro'> <u>Hi, I’m Isabella!</u>  Since a very young age, I have loved sharks. I have read many books and watched many hours of Shark Week to know a thing 
        or two about these majestic creatures. Heres what I know! <b>I hope you enjoy!</b>
</p>
    <p id = 'main'>Sharks are amazing creatures that have been around for over 400 million years.
        They belong to a group of fish called Chondrichthyes, which means their skeletons are made of cartilage instead of bone. There are over 500 types of sharks
        such as the tiny dwarf lantern shark, which is smaller than a ruler, and the giant whale shark, which can grow over 40 feet long! Each shark has completely 
        different features which makes them so interesting.
        Sharks are crucial for keeping the ocean healthy. They help control the population of other sea creatures, making sure no single 
        species takes over. This balance helps coral reefs and seagrass beds stay strong and healthy. 
        Although sharks have a scary reputation, most are not dangerous to humans. Humans are more likely to be a much bigger threat to sharks.
        Every year, millions of sharks are killed by humans for their fins, meat, and other products. Pollution and climate change also make it
        harder for sharks to survive. That’s why it’s so important to protect sharks and their habitats. By taking care of sharks, we help keep 
        the ocean balanced and healthy for future generations. They are awesome creatures that need to be protected!
