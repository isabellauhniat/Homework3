    <p id = 'main'>Sharks come in many different shapes, sizes, and behaviors, with each species having unique characteristics. 
        My favorite type of shark is the hammerhead!  The bull, great white, and tiger sharks are also pretty great and are some 
        of the most well-known species in the ocean. 
        Here are some facts about these amazing creatures:
        <b>1. </b>The hammerhead shark is easily recognized by its wide, flat head shaped like 
        a hammer. This unique head shape helps them scan a larger area of the ocean floor to find prey. Hammerhead sharks are usually
        found in warm, tropical waters and are known to travel in large groups during the day. 
        
        <b>2. </b>The bull shark, on the other hand, is known for its aggressive behavior and ability to thrive in both saltwater and freshwater. 
        They can swim up rivers and have been spotted in places far from the ocean, like rivers. Their strong build and aggressive hunting 
        behavior make them one of the most dangerous shark species. 
        <b>3. </b>The great white shark is the most famous shark species, known from the 
        movie Jaws, for its large size and powerful presence. They can grow up to 20 
        feet long and weigh over 2 tons. Great whites are very skilled at hunting, often hunting seals, sea lions, and large fish. Despite 
        their fierce reputation, they are not naturally aggressive toward humans. 
        
        <b>4. </b>Tiger sharks are another strong species, named for the dark vertical stripes along their bodies, which resemble a tiger. They
        are known for eating just about anything, such as fish, sea turtles, birds, and even garbage like tires or license plates. They 
        are known as the ‘garbage cans of the sea’ for this behavior. Their curiosity
        and willingness to eat almost anything make them one of the most versatile hunters in the ocean.
